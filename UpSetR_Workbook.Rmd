#Comparisons

Now that I have GO terms and genes under selection, its prudent to compare. Let's see what upsetR is saying.

```{r}
install.packages("UpSetR")
library("UpSetR")
```

I've written a script that does everything I need here.

1. Makes tables of GOterms based on absence / presence (1/0) in each lineage/sociality

2. Makes master tables and separate immune / random only tables

3. Write these tables in an output folder 

```{r}
source("Scripts/makeUpsetR.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```

##Canon versus Noncanon (input)

##Apidae Socialities

##Halictidae
